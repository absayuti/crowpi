# C Programming on CrowPi
C program examples on using the GPIO of a Raspberry Pi on CrowPi learning kit

This is collection of C programs written on a CrowPi learning kit. CrowPi comes with pre-connected input/output devices. So, the examples presented here use specific GPIO pins as per on CrowPi. However, standalone Raspberry Pi systems can also be used as long as you use the same GPIO pins as in the example programs. However, this guide will not discuss how the hardware interfacing is done. You may need to refer to other documents for that purpose.

CrowPi_pins.txt list the GPIO pins used/connected to sensors/devices on CrowPi.

Besides CrowPi, you will also need access to the Internet to download various software including Raspbian OS and C libraries.
